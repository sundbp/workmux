# sandbox

Commands for managing container sandbox functionality.

## Subcommands

### sandbox build

Build the sandbox container image locally (two-stage: base + agent).

```bash
workmux sandbox build
```

Builds the image locally for the configured agent. This is an alternative to using the pre-built image from `ghcr.io/raine/workmux-sandbox`. Most users should use `workmux sandbox pull` instead.

### sandbox pull

Pull the latest sandbox image from the container registry.

```bash
workmux sandbox pull
```

Pulls the pre-built image for the configured agent from `ghcr.io/raine/workmux-sandbox:{agent}`. This is the recommended way to get and update the sandbox image.

### sandbox init-dockerfile

Export customizable Dockerfile templates for building your own sandbox image.

```bash
workmux sandbox init-dockerfile [--force]
```

**Options:**

- `--force` - Overwrite existing Dockerfiles

Creates `Dockerfile.base` and `Dockerfile.{agent}` (e.g., `Dockerfile.claude`) in the current directory. The base Dockerfile contains the common foundation (Debian, git, workmux), and the agent Dockerfile adds agent-specific installation on top.

### sandbox auth

Authenticate with the agent inside the sandbox container. Run this once before using sandbox mode.

```bash
workmux sandbox auth
```

This starts an interactive session inside your configured sandbox container, allowing you to authenticate your agent. Credentials are saved to `~/.claude-sandbox.json`, which is separate from your host agent credentials. The host `~/.claude/` directory is mounted for settings.

### sandbox run

Run a command inside a Lima sandbox (internal, used by pane setup).

```bash
workmux sandbox run <worktree> -- <command...>
```

This is an internal command generated by `wrap_for_lima()` during pane setup. It runs the host-side supervisor process that:

1. Ensures the Lima VM is running
2. Starts a TCP RPC server on a random port
3. Runs the command inside the VM via `limactl shell`
4. Passes `WM_SANDBOX_GUEST=1`, `WM_RPC_HOST`, `WM_RPC_PORT`, and `WM_RPC_TOKEN` env vars to the guest
5. Exits with the agent command's exit code

The RPC server handles requests from the guest workmux binary:

- `SetStatus` -- updates the tmux pane status icon
- `SetTitle` -- renames the tmux window
- `Heartbeat` -- health check
- `SpawnAgent` -- runs `workmux add` on the host to create a new worktree

### sandbox install-dev

Cross-compile and install workmux into container images and running Lima VMs for local development.

```bash
# Cross-compile and install into containers and running VMs
workmux sandbox install-dev

# Use release profile (slower build, faster binary)
workmux sandbox install-dev --release

# Skip compilation, copy existing binary
workmux sandbox install-dev --skip-build
```

**Options:**

- `--skip-build` - Skip cross-compilation and copy the previously built binary
- `--release` - Use release profile (default is debug for faster iteration)

This is a developer-only command for getting local workmux builds into sandbox environments. The host macOS binary cannot run inside Linux containers or VMs, so this command cross-compiles for the correct Linux architecture.

For container sandboxes, it builds a thin overlay image (`FROM <image>` + `COPY workmux`) on top of the configured sandbox image, replacing it in-place. For Lima VMs, it copies the binary into each running VM.

**Prerequisites:**

- Rust cross-compilation target: `rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- Cross-linker: `brew install messense/macos-cross-toolchains/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`

The binary is installed to `~/.local/bin/workmux` inside the VM, which is already on PATH.

### sandbox stop

Stop Lima VMs to free resources.

```bash
# Interactive mode - show list and select VM
workmux sandbox stop

# Stop specific VM
workmux sandbox stop <vm-name>

# Stop all workmux VMs
workmux sandbox stop --all

# Skip confirmation prompt
workmux sandbox stop --all --yes
```

**Arguments:**

- `<vm-name>` - Name of the VM to stop (optional, conflicts with `--all`)

**Options:**

- `--all` - Stop all workmux VMs (those starting with `wm-` prefix)
- `-y, --yes` - Skip confirmation prompt

This command helps you stop running Lima VMs created by workmux to free up system resources. When run without arguments, it shows an interactive list of running workmux VMs for you to choose from. The command will ask for confirmation before stopping any VMs unless `--yes` is provided.

**Notes:**

- This command only works with Lima backend and requires `limactl` to be installed
- Only running VMs are shown in interactive mode
- If a specified VM is already stopped, the command reports this and exits successfully
- Non-interactive environments (pipes, scripts) require `--all` or a specific VM name

## Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Enable in config (~/.config/workmux/config.yaml or .workmux.yaml)
#    sandbox:
#      enabled: true

# 2. Authenticate
workmux sandbox auth

# The pre-built image is pulled automatically on first run.
# To pull it explicitly:
workmux sandbox pull
```

## Example

```bash
# Pull the latest sandbox image
workmux sandbox pull
# Output:
# Pulling image 'ghcr.io/raine/workmux-sandbox:claude'...
# Image 'ghcr.io/raine/workmux-sandbox:claude' is up to date.

# Then authenticate
workmux sandbox auth
# Output:
# Starting sandbox auth flow...
# This will open Claude in container 'ghcr.io/raine/workmux-sandbox:claude' for authentication.
# Your credentials will be saved to ~/.claude-sandbox.json
#
# [Interactive agent session]
#
# Auth complete. Sandbox credentials saved.
```
