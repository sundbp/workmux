# Changelog

<!-- skipped: v0.1.27 -->
<!-- skipped: v0.1.25 -->
<!-- skipped: v0.1.8 -->

## v0.1.46 (2025-12-09)

- Added `--pr` flag to `list` command to show PR status alongside worktrees,
  displaying PR numbers and state icons (open, draft, merged, closed)
- Added spinner feedback for slow operations like GitHub API calls

## v0.1.45 (2025-12-08)

- Shell completions now suggest proper values for `--base`, `--into`, and
  `--prompt-file` flags (bash, zsh)
- Fixed an error with the `pre_delete` hook when removing worktrees that were
  manually deleted from the filesystem

## v0.1.44 (2025-12-06)

- In agent status tracking, the "waiting" (💬) status icon now auto-clears
  window is focused, matching the behavior of the "done" (✅️) status.

## v0.1.43 (2025-12-05)

- Improved the default config template generated by `workmux init`

## v0.1.42 (2025-12-05)

- Added pre-built binaries for Linux ARM64 (aarch64) architecture

## v0.1.41 (2025-12-04)

- Commands `open`, `path`, `remove`, and `merge` now accept worktree names (the
  directory name shown in tmux) in addition to branch names, making it easier to
  work with worktrees when the directory name differs from the branch

## v0.1.40 (2025-12-03)

- Added `--auto-name` (`-A`) flag to automatically generate branch names from
  your prompt using an LLM (uses the `llm` tool), so you can skip naming
  branches yourself
- Added `auto_name.model` and `auto_name.system_prompt` config options to
  customize the LLM model and prompt used for branch name generation

## v0.1.39 (2025-12-03)

- New worktree windows are now inserted after the last workmux window instead of
  at the end of the window list, keeping your worktree windows grouped together

## v0.1.38 (2025-12-03)

- Fixed branches created with `--base` not having upstream tracking
  configuration properly unset from the base branch

## v0.1.37 (2025-12-03)

- Fixed panes not loading shell profiles, which broke tools like nvm etc. that
  depend on login shell initialization

## v0.1.36 (2025-12-01)

- Added `--into` flag to `merge` command for merging into branches other than
  main (e.g., `workmux merge feature --into develop`)
- Fixed config loading and file operations when running commands from inside a
  worktree
- Removed `--delete-remote` flag from `merge` and `remove` commands

## v0.1.35 (2025-12-01)

- Added agent status tracking in tmux window names, showing icons for different
  Claude Code states (🤖 working, 💬 waiting, ✅ done). The "done" status
  auto-clears when you focus the window.

## v0.1.34 (2025-11-30)

- Fixed worktree path calculation when running `add` from inside an existing
  worktree, which previously created nested paths instead of sibling worktrees

## v0.1.33 (2025-11-30)

- Added support for GitHub fork branch format (`user:branch`) in `add` command,
  allowing direct checkout of fork branches copied from GitHub's UI

## v0.1.32 (2025-11-30)

- Added OpenCode agent support: prompts are now automatically passed using the
  `-p` flag when using `--prompt-file` or `--prompt-editor` with
  `--agent opencode`

## v0.1.31 (2025-11-29)

  window naming

  derived from branches (`full` or `basename`)

  rebase, or squash)

  `open`, `merge`, and `remove` commands (bash, zsh, fish)

## v0.1.26 (2025-11-25)

- Added `--pr` flag to checkout a GitHub pull request directly into a new
  worktree
- Fixed version managers (nvm, pnpm, mise, etc.) being shadowed by stale PATH
  entries when running pane commands

- Fixed duplicate command announcement when running merge workflow

## v0.1.24 (2025-11-22)

  state with guidance on how to resolve

  worktree, useful for verifying the merge before removing the branch

  the main worktree instead of staying in the deleted directory

  (`foreach`), making it easier to specify multi-worktree generation without CLI
  flags
- Added `size` and `percentage` options for pane configuration to control pane
  dimensions when splitting
- Fixed prompt editor temporary file now using `.md` extension for better editor
  syntax highlighting
- Fixed Gemini agent startup issues

## v0.1.21 (2025-11-18)

- Switched templating engine from Tera to MiniJinja (Jinja2-compatible) for
  branch names and prompts. Existing templates should work unchanged.

## v0.1.20 (2025-11-18)

- Fixed prompts starting with a dash (e.g. "- foo") being incorrectly
  interpreted as CLI flags
- The `rm` command now automatically uses the correct base branch that was used
  when the worktree was created, instead of defaulting to the main branch

## v0.1.19 (2025-11-17)

- Added `--with-changes` flag to `add` command: move uncommitted changes from
  your current worktree to a new one, useful when you've started working on the
  wrong branch
- Added `--patch` flag: interactively select which changes to move when using
  `--with-changes`

- New branches now default to branching from your currently checked out branch
  instead of the main branch's remote tracking branch
- Removed the `--from-current` flag (no longer needed since this is now the
  default behavior)

## v0.1.17 (2025-11-17)

- Added multi-agent workflows: create multiple worktrees from a single command
  using `-a agent1 -a agent2`, `-n count`, or `--foreach` matrix options
- Added background mode (`-b`, `--background`) to create worktrees without
  switching to them
- Added support for prompt templating with variables like `{{ agent }}`,
  `{{ num }}`, and custom `--foreach` variables

  without explicit `--base`)

- Added `--prompt` (`-p`) and `--prompt-file` (`-P`) options to `workmux add`
  for attaching a prompt to new worktrees
- Added `--keep-branch` (`-k`) option to `workmux remove` to preserve the local
  branch while removing the worktree and tmux window

## v0.1.14 (2025-11-14)

- Added `--base` option to specify a base branch, commit, or tag when creating a
  new worktree

  useful for stacking feature branches
- Added support for creating worktrees from remote branches (e.g.,
  `workmux add origin/feature-branch`)
- Added support for copying directories (not just files) in file operations

## v0.1.13 (2025-11-13)

- Fixed `merge` and `remove` commands failing when run from within the worktree
  being deleted
- Added safety check to prevent accidentally deleting a branch that's checked
  out in the main worktree
- Fixed pane startup commands not loading shell environment tools (like direnv,
  nvm, rbenv) before running

## v0.1.11 (2025-11-11)

- Added `pre_delete` hooks that run before worktree deletion, with automatic
  detection of Node.js projects to fast-delete `node_modules` directories in the
  background

  can be created without a command (just a shell)
- Added `target` option for panes to split from any existing pane, not just the
  most recent one
- Tmux panes now use login shells for consistent environment across all panes
- The `create` command now displays which base branch was used
- Improved validation for pane configurations with helpful error messages

## v0.1.10 (2025-11-09)

- Post-create hooks now run before the tmux window opens, so the new window
  appears ready to use instead of showing setup commands running

- Automatically run `pnpm install` when creating worktrees in pnpm projects

## v0.1.5 (2025-11-08)

- Added `--from` flag to `add` command to specify which branch, commit, or tag
  to branch from
- Fixed `rm` command failing when run from within the worktree being removed
- New worktree branches no longer track a remote upstream by default

  defaults in `~/.config/workmux/config.yaml` that apply across all projects
- Project configs can inherit from global settings using `<global>` placeholder
  in lists
- After merging or removing a worktree, automatically switches to the main
  branch tmux window if it exists
