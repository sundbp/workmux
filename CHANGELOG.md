## v0.1.71 (2026-01-06)

- Added pane preview to the status dashboard, showing live terminal output from
  the selected agent
- Added input mode: press `i` to send keystrokes directly to the selected
  agent's pane without switching windows, press Escape to exit
- Added preview scrolling with Ctrl+U/D
- Agents are now automatically removed from the status list when they exit
- Priority sorting now uses elapsed time as a tiebreaker

## v0.1.70 (2026-01-06)

- Added smart sorting to the status dashboard with four modes: Priority (by
  status importance), Project (grouped by project), Recency (newest first), and
  Natural (tmux order). Press `s` to cycle through modes; it is saved across
  sessions.

## v0.1.69 (2026-01-05)

- Added `status` command: a TUI dashboard for monitoring all active agents
  across tmux sessions, with quick-jump keys (1-9), peek mode, and keyboard
  navigation
- The "done" (✅) status no longer gets replaced by "waiting" (💬) when Claude
  sends idle prompts, so completed sessions stay marked as done

## v0.1.68 (2026-01-05)

- Added `docs` command to view the README

## v0.1.67 (2026-01-04)

- Improved compatibility with non-POSIX shells like nushell
- Commands for starting agent with a prompt no longer pollute shell history

## v0.1.66 (2026-01-03)

- Added `--no-verify` (`-n`) flag to `merge` command to skip pre-merge hooks
- The `merge` command now works when run from subdirectories within a worktree

## v0.1.65 (2026-01-02)

- The `open` command now switches to an existing window by default instead of
  erroring when a window already exists
- Added `--new` (`-n`) flag to `open` command to force opening a duplicate
  window (creates suffix like `-2`, `-3`)
- The `open` command now supports prompts via `-p`, `-P`, and `-e` flags,
  matching the `add` command

## v0.1.63 (2026-01-02)

- Linux binaries now use musl for better compatibility across different Linux
  distributions

## v0.1.62 (2025-12-29)

- The `merge` command with `--keep` no longer requires a clean worktree, since
  the worktree won't be deleted anyway

## v0.1.61 (2025-12-27)

- Log files are now stored in the XDG state directory
  (`~/.local/state/workmux/`)

## v0.1.60 (2025-12-26)

- Added `close` command to close a worktree's tmux window while keeping the
  worktree on disk. It's basically an alias for tmux's `kill-window`

## v0.1.59 (2025-12-26)

- Added `pre_merge` hook to run commands (like tests or linters) before merging,
  allowing you to catch issues before they land in your main branch
- Added `pre_remove` hook that runs before worktree removal, with environment
  variables (`WM_HANDLE`, `WM_WORKTREE_PATH`, `WM_PROJECT_ROOT`) for backup or
  cleanup workflows
- The `post_create` hook now receives `WM_WORKTREE_PATH` and `WM_PROJECT_ROOT`
  environment variables, matching the other hooks

## v0.1.57 (2025-12-23)

- Fixed terminal input not being displayed after creating a worktree with
  `workmux add` on bash ([#17](https://github.com/raine/workmux/pull/17))

## v0.1.55 (2025-12-21)

- The `merge` command now allows untracked files in the target worktree, only
  blocking when there are uncommitted changes to tracked files

## v0.1.54 (2025-12-17)

- The `remove` command now accepts multiple worktree names, allowing you to
  clean up several worktrees in a single command (e.g.,
  `workmux rm feature-a feature-b`)

## v0.1.53 (2025-12-17)

- Added JSON lines support for stdin input: pipe JSON objects to `workmux add`
  and each key automatically becomes a template variable, making it easy to use
  structured data from tools like `jq` in prompts and branch names
- Template errors now show which variables are missing and list available ones,
  helping catch typos in branch name templates or prompts before worktrees are
  created
- Fixed "directory already exists" errors when creating worktrees after a
  previous cleanup was interrupted by background processes recreating files

## v0.1.52 (2025-12-17)

- Added `--max-concurrent` flag to limit how many worktrees run simultaneously,
  useful for creating worker pools that process items without overwhelming
  system resources or hitting API rate limits
- Added `{{ index }}` template variable for branch names and prompts in
  multi-worktree modes, providing a 1-indexed counter across all generated
  worktrees

## v0.1.51 (2025-12-16)

- Added `--wait` (`-W`) flag to `add` command to block until the created tmux
  window is closed, useful for scripting workflows
- Added stdin input support for multi-worktree generation: pipe lines to
  `workmux add` to create multiple worktrees, with each line available as
  `{{ input }}` in prompts
- Fixed duplicate remote fetch when using `--pr` or fork branch syntax
  (`user:branch`)

## v0.1.50 (2025-12-15)

- Fixed a crash in `workmux completions bash`
  ([#14](https://github.com/raine/workmux/issues/14))

## v0.1.49 (2025-12-15)

- Added `--all` flag to `remove` command to remove all worktrees at once (except
  the main worktree), with safety checks for uncommitted changes and unmerged
  commits
- Now shows an error when using `-p`/`--prompt` without an agent pane
  configured, instead of silently ignoring the prompt

## v0.1.48 (2025-12-10)

- Removed automatic `node_modules` symlink default for Node.js projects

## v0.1.47 (2025-12-09)

- Added `--gone` flag to `rm` command to clean up worktrees whose remote
  branches have been deleted (e.g., after PRs are merged)

## v0.1.46 (2025-12-09)

- Added `--pr` flag to `list` command to show PR status alongside worktrees,
  displaying PR numbers and state icons (open, draft, merged, closed)
- Added spinner feedback for slow operations like GitHub API calls

## v0.1.45 (2025-12-08)

- Shell completions now suggest proper values for `--base`, `--into`, and
  `--prompt-file` flags (bash, zsh)

## v0.1.42 (2025-12-05)

- Added pre-built binaries for Linux ARM64 (aarch64) architecture

## v0.1.41 (2025-12-04)

- Commands `open`, `path`, `remove`, and `merge` now accept worktree names (the
  directory name shown in tmux) in addition to branch names, making it easier to
  work with worktrees when the directory name differs from the branch

## v0.1.40 (2025-12-03)

- Added `--auto-name` (`-A`) flag to automatically generate branch names from
  your prompt using an LLM (uses the `llm` tool), so you can skip naming
  branches yourself
- Added `auto_name.model` and `auto_name.system_prompt` config options to
  customize the LLM model and prompt used for branch name generation

## v0.1.39 (2025-12-03)

- New worktree windows are now inserted after the last workmux window instead of
  at the end of the window list, keeping your worktree windows grouped together

- Fixed branches created with `--base` not having upstream tracking
  configuration properly unset from the base branch

## v0.1.37 (2025-12-03)

  Claude Code states (🤖 working, 💬 waiting, ✅ done). The "done" status
  auto-clears when you focus the window.

## v0.1.34 (2025-11-30)

- Fixed worktree path calculation when running `add` from inside an existing
  worktree, which previously created nested paths instead of sibling worktrees

  allowing direct checkout of fork branches copied from GitHub's UI

## v0.1.32 (2025-11-30)

- Added OpenCode agent support: prompts are now automatically passed using the
  `-p` flag when using `--prompt-file` or `--prompt-editor` with
  `--agent opencode`

  worktree, useful for verifying the merge before removing the branch
- Fixed a bug where multi-agent worktrees had incorrect agent configuration for
  worktrees after the first one
- After closing a worktree (merge or remove), the terminal now navigates back to
  the main worktree instead of staying in the deleted directory

  (`foreach`), making it easier to specify multi-worktree generation without CLI
  flags

  branch names and prompts. Existing templates should work unchanged.

## v0.1.20 (2025-11-18)

- Fixed prompts starting with a dash (e.g. "- foo") being incorrectly
  interpreted as CLI flags
- The `rm` command now automatically uses the correct base branch that was used
  when the worktree was created, instead of defaulting to the main branch

## v0.1.19 (2025-11-17)

  your current worktree to a new one, useful when you've started working on the
  wrong branch
- Added `--patch` flag: interactively select which changes to move when using
  `--with-changes`

  switching to them
- Added support for prompt templating with variables like `{{ agent }}`,
  `{{ num }}`, and custom `--foreach` variables

## v0.1.13 (2025-11-13)

- Fixed `merge` and `remove` commands failing when run from within the worktree
  being deleted

  nvm, rbenv) before running

## v0.1.11 (2025-11-11)

- Added `pre_delete` hooks that run before worktree deletion, with automatic
  detection of Node.js projects to fast-delete `node_modules` directories in the
